[The puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2025/)

Solutions (no to AI, yes to Googling regex syntax):

[Day 1](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2025/aoc01.nb.html) &ndash; powered by
modulo arithmetic, a 621,136 row dataframe, and for loops (no shame).

[Day 2](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2025/aoc02.nb.html) &ndash; part 2 was
harder than it looked until I reread the question. Lesson learned, one day...

[Day 3](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2025/aoc03.nb.html) &ndash; part 2 was
slowed down by a silly vector indexing error. All done after a few
debug prints. Powered by recursion and {gmp} for big integers.

[Day 4](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2025/aoc04.nb.html) &ndash; slow (11
min on part 2) but correct :)

[Day 5](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2025/aoc05.nb.html) &ndash; done.

[Day 6](https://inductivestep.github.io/aoc2025/aoc06.nb.html) &ndash; done.
